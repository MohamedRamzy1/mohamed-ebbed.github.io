3D mesh is a common way to represent the 3D sur-faces and it is heavily utilized across many various industries. However, 3D scans of the objects are usually very noisy, occluded, incomplete, irregular and sometimes less structured due to oversmoothing. In recent years, different deep learning approaches have shown huge development in dealing with different tasks for 3D data. As a part of this project, we are going to implement Scan2Mesh [2], which is a data-driven generative approach that transforms partial range scans to com-plete structured 3D mesh representations. Proposed method generates meshes as indexed face sets, and significantly cleaner and more CAD-like results are generated.
